# Major_Project

Multiple Disease Detection is a transformative application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques that addresses the growing need for advanced healthcare diagnostics. The proposed system integrates a diverse dataset comprising medical records, symptoms, and diagnostic information related to multiple diseases. We have considered various diseases for now that are Heart, Liver, and Diabetes and in the future, many more diseases can be added. The user has to enter various parameters of the disease and the system would display the output whether he/she has the disease or not.
